## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics and Data Science at
Northwestern University and a Research Assistant at the Institute for
Policy Research. My research develops statistically rigorous methods for
exploratory analysis in hierarchical and multilevel data structures.
More specifically, I focus on advancing unsupervised learning and
machine learning techniques tailored to the complexities of multivariate
meta-analysis, with the goal of improving the reliability and
interpretability of evidence synthesis across diverse empirical domains.
